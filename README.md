# School-App-System-Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is my individual portfolio for our course project during Phase 2 (Enterprise Configuration & Delivery).  
It includes the problem being solved, the system vision, my role, and course artifacts.

## Problem Being Solved
Our school app experience can be confusing or inconsistent for users who need quick access to important school information. This project documents the main issues and what needs to be improved.

## System Vision
Our vision is to create a school app system that is clear, reliable, and easy to use so students and staff can access the information they need in one place.

## My Role on the Team
**Role:** [integration analyst]  
**Contribution:** I complete assigned tasks, communicate progress clearly, and help document decisions and requirements.

## Course Artifacts
Artifacts are stored in the **/artifacts** folder.
